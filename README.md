## DESCRIPTION
Delani-studio is a fictional studio landing page that will show my prowess in jQuery and Bootstrap along with other web development scripting languages
as i have learnt in Moringa School.

## DEPENDENCIES
A good internet connection and an internet browser preferably Chrome or Chromium browsers.

## SETUP
Open the live link to the website 
It requires Internet connection to be able to connect.
If you are using a Linux or Mac based operating system :*open your terminal and type git clone https://github.com/Duncan-Kiragu/Delani-Studio.git*
extract the file
cd to the Akan-Names directory
Open the index.html on your favorite browser but *preferably Chrome or Chromium browser*

## BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT(B.D.D)
The website has a form at the bottom whereby they can input their name, e-mail address and message to the website creator using the
application programming interface premade by mailchimp
After verification it alerts the user that the message has been received and a client side e-mail is sent to the user while new entries reflect in the controlling mailchimp live server.


## KNOWN BUGS
The hover effect used is animated meaning that it has a time delay function instead of an exclusive realtime hover effect.


## TECHNOLOGIES USED
*HTML 5*
*CSS 3*
*JAVASCRIPT*
*GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE*
*JQUERY*
*BOOTSTRAP*
